## Regression: simple example


To make things more concrete, let's take a look at the simplest example of machine learning: linear regression. If you have ever taken a high school statistics course, you have probably solved these by hand!

Linear regression in 2d
Linear regression in 2d (p5?)

Variations
 - logistic regression/classification

In practice, linear regression is almost never used because most of the functions we care about are not so simple, and more complex methods are required.
