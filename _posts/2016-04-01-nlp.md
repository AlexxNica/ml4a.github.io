This chapter is about applications of machine learning to natural language processing. like ml, NLP is a nebulous term with several precise definitions and most have something to do wth making sense from text. This chapter will take a broad view of NLP


“Deep Learning waves have lapped at the shores of computational linguistics for several years now, but 2015 seems like the year when the full force of the tsunami hit the major Natural Language Processing (NLP) conferences.” -Dr. Christopher D. Manning, Dec 2015

I would say that the last key factor is a community. Recent strong results across multiple application domains have started a virtuous circle: As more people shift their attention to Deep Learning research and applications we are collectively accelerating the field's progress, which in turn increases the amount of strong results.
