## What is machine learning?

Although the term \"machine learning\" has only been in common usage since the 1980s, many of the core concepts and algorithms associated with machine learning go back much further than the term itself. It became widely recognized as a field in its own right when many of these concepts coalesced together as researchers began to apply techniques from computational statistics and ___, to solve problems in artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence had at that point been largely characterized by rule-based or \"expert\" systems to solve tasks in optimization. A typical example. Machine learning researchers recognized that such algorithms would have limited effectiveness for tasks that had -- scalability, etc. 

Although most still regard ML as a subfield of AI, ML is so predominant in AI research that outside of academic contexts, the terms are often used interchangeably.


Emergence of Deep learning

In the 2010s, many machine learning researchers who were working with multilayer (\"deep\") architectures - particularly deep neural networks - began to use the term \"deep learning.\"  

Schmidhuber made DLC. His post provoked a great deal of commentary from numerous people, including very well-known researchers, spurring arguably the most academic and complicated flamewar of all-time.
