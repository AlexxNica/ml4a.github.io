## Deep learning: broad overview

Like machine learning, many of the concepts and algorithms associated with deep learning go back much farther than usage of the term. Some, like neural networks, predate machine learning itself and were core concepts in early artificial intelligence research. It has recently gained mainstream acceptance as a field with many researchers increasingly identifying with the term. 

Deep learning has been widely accredited with the recent resurgence of popular interest in machine learning. This has come about for a number of reasons.

1) Deep neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art results in a variety of critical tasks with which we are familiar. They began to set top benchmarks for speech recognition (Siri, etc) starting in 2009, and especially came to the spotlight in 2012 when a deep convolutional neural network by Sutskever and co, won the ISVRLC image classification competition, cutting an unprecedented 10% off the misclassification rate (26% to 16%).

2) Deep learning has been received a great deal of investment from the largest tech companies. Facebook (Yann Lecun), Google (Deep Mind), Amazon, .  Apple is suspected of ramping up deep learning research as well but because of their secretive nature [link to that article], they have largely fallen behind. In December 2015, a non-profit called OpenAI was introduced with $1B investment from Elon Musk among others and a team of prominent researchers almost entirely associated with deep learning.

3) Contrary to previous fields of AI + CS and scientific academia in general, many deep learning researchers are actively engaged in outreach, maintaining blogs, publishing open access papers, visible on social media. 


## What's so deep about it?

Deep learning, in the simplest sense, refers to versions of machine learning algorithms in which data flows through multiple layers of non-linear transformations (more on this later). In practice, the most successful algorithms have been versions of multilayer neural networks, but others exist as well (Deep belief networks, etc). 

These are useful for learning representations of data

are multilayer perceptrons deep neural networks?
