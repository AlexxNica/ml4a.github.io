DoodleClassifier is an [openframeworks](http://www.openframeworks.cc) application, part of the [ml4a-ofx collection](https://github.com/ml4a/ml4a-ofx/), which lets you train a classifier to accurately recognize drawings ("doodles") from a camera.

It was first used in a project called DoodleTunes by [Andreas Refsgaard](https://andreasrefsgaard.dk/) and [Gene Kogan](https://www.genekogan.com/), which recognized doodles of musical instruments and turned them into music being made in Ableton Live.
