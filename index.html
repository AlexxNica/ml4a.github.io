<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

<p/>
ml4a.github.io is an in-development book about machine learning, being written by <a href="http://www.genekogan.com">Gene Kogan</a> (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/genekogan">@genekogan</a>) and <a href="http://frnsys.com/">Francis Tseng</a> (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/frnsys">@frnsys</a>). Expected first draft: <strike>March</strike> <strike>May</strike> <strike>June</strike> <strike>August 2016</strike> <b>early-2017</b>.
<p/>
<i>Why the delays?</i> The delays in the release schedule can be attributed to three factors.
<ul>
	<li><b>Changes in scope:</b> initially, ml4a was to be a collection of reading materials for a <a href="/classes/itp-S16">single class</a>, and now seeks to be more broadly useful, necessitating the development of new features and chapters. Over time, <a href="/demos">Demos</a> and <a href="/guides">Guides</a> were elevated from supporting materials to the book into full-fledged sections of their own.</li>
	<li><b>The goalposts keep moving:</b> since the initial version of this page went up, we've seen <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/google-ai-algorithm-masters-ancient-game-of-go-1.19234">AlphaGo</a>, the <a href="https://research.googleblog.com/2016/04/announcing-tensorflow-08-now-with.html">announcement of TensorFlow</a>, <a href="http://www.evolvingai.org/synthesizing">deep generator nets</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05343">synthetic gradients</a>, and many other major milestones in the field. To keep ml4a contemporary, we have to learn how to keep up with the field, which is something we're learning how to do.</li>
	<li><b>Balancing other goals</b>: ml4a seeks to be an independent and non-commercial resource, and all contributions to it are unpaid, at least for now. Thus, it must be balanced with the necessities of life, e.g. paid work, and the occasional <a href="https://twitter.com/genekogan/status/768770967380172801">night at the discotheque</a>, which slows down our progress. We are slowly but surely <a href="https://github.com/ml4a">catching up</a>. Thanks for your patience.

Draft chapters may be viewed <a href="index/">here</a>. Some are nearly complete, some are very rough, some are just stubs. <a href="/guides">Guides</a> and <a href="/demos">Demos</a> are being released as we go.
